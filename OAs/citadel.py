# a cyber security firm is building a team of hackers to take down a network of cybercriminals. 
# The skill level of the ith hacker of team A is team_a[i] and of team B is team_b[i]. 
# A team is considered strong if for each index i a hacker is selected either from team A or team B, and the skill levels of selected team are non-decreasing. 
# given two arrays team_a and team_b of n integers each, chose two indices i and j such that the subarrays [team_a[i], team_a[i+1]...team_a[j]] and [team_b[i], 
# team_b[i+1]...team_b[j]] can forma strong team. Find the maximum possible value of (j-i+1) i.e the length of the chosen subarray.

# there are two rows of legos, rowA and rowB. Both rows have posoitive int values printed opn them, however some values are denoted by 0 which are missing. 
# Students need to incoirporate the missing value . the task is to replace the 0 with a positive integer such that the sums of both array sare equal.
# return the minimum usm posisble if it is not possible make the sums equal return -1
